Cookmate is a recipe-sharing web application that allows users to register, publish, share, rate, and taste-test recipes from all across the world.

as a user, you can create an account, log in, and add a recipe. You can also view all the recipes on the platform and rate them. 

<h2>How to use:</h2>

I think you should give the platform a whirl. Visit https://cookmate.vercel.app/

But if you want to run this project on your own machine follow these steps:

1. Download the files available (make sure they're unzipped) in this repo or just clone it.

2. Open the project in your preferred IDE (I use VSCode).

3. Run npm install to install all dependencies. 

4. Run npm run dev to start the development server. 

5. Navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view and use the application. 

<h2>Technologies:</h2>

This app is full-stack built using NextJS, Connected to a Vercel Postgres database, and has Prisma as the ORM. All styles are applied using Tailwind CSS.
